# Part 2: Implementing Secure User Authentication with Amazon Cognito

Welcome back! In Part 1, we laid out the blueprint for our serverless social media application. Now, let's implement one of the most crucial features: user authentication. We'll use Amazon Cognito to handle user registration, email verification, and secure login flows.

## Setting Up Amazon Cognito

First, let's create our User Pool in Amazon Cognito. This will serve as our user directory and handle all authentication-related tasks.

### Creating a User Pool

Navigate to the Amazon Cognito console and follow these steps:

1. Click "Create user pool"
2. Choose "Email" as the sign-in option
3. Configure security requirements:
   - Password minimum length: 8 characters
   - Require numbers and special characters
   - Enable self-service account recovery

### Configuring App Integration

Now we'll set up our application client to communicate with Cognito:

```typescript
// src/config/cognito.ts
export const cognitoConfig = {
  UserPoolId: 'your-user-pool-id',
  ClientId: 'your-client-id',
  Region: 'your-region'
};
```

## Implementing Authentication in React

Let's create our authentication context and components.

### Authentication Context

```typescript
// src/context/AuthContext.tsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { CognitoUser } from 'amazon-cognito-identity-js';
import { cognitoConfig } from '../config/cognito';

// ... [Rest of the context code will be shown here]
```

### Sign Up Flow

Here's how we'll implement the sign-up process:

```typescript
// src/pages/SignUp.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

// ... [Sign up component code will be shown here]
```

### Email Verification

After signup, users need to verify their email:

```typescript
// src/pages/VerifyEmail.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

// ... [Verification component code will be shown here]
```

### Login Implementation

Let's create a secure login form:

[SCREENSHOT 7: Show the login form UI]
Caption: "Secure login form with error handling"

```typescript
// src/pages/Login.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

// ... [Login component code will be shown here]
```

## Protected Routes

We need to ensure certain routes are only accessible to authenticated users:

[SCREENSHOT 8: Show the protected routes implementation]
Caption: "Implementing protected routes in React"

```typescript
// src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

// ... [Protected route component code will be shown here]
```

## Testing the Authentication Flow

Let's test our implementation:

[SCREENSHOT 10: Show successful login]

## Security Best Practices

Here are some key security considerations we've implemented:

1. Secure password policies
2. Email verification
3. JWT token handling
4. Session management
5. Protected routes
6. Error handling

## What's Next?

Now that we have authentication working, in Part 3 we'll build the core feature of our social media app: the post creation and feed system. We'll set up our DynamoDB tables, create Lambda functions for post management, and build the frontend components for creating and displaying posts.

Stay tuned!
