# Part 4: Adding Social Features - Likes, Comments, and Real-time Updates

Welcome to the final part of our series! We'll now add the social features that make our application truly interactive: likes, comments, and real-time updates. We'll also look at performance optimization and scaling considerations.

## Extending the Data Model

First, let's update our DynamoDB schema to support likes and comments:

```typescript
// Types for our new features
interface Like {
  userId: string;
  postId: string;
  createdAt: number;
}

interface Comment {
  commentId: string;
  postId: string;
  userId: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

## Implementing WebSocket Support

Let's add real-time capabilities:

```typescript
// src/components/LikeButton.tsx
import { useMutation } from 'react-query';

// ... [Like button component code will be shown here]
```

## Comment System

### Backend Implementation

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential enhancements you could add:

1. Direct messaging
2. User mentions
3. Hashtag support
4. Content moderation
5. Analytics dashboard

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've built a full-featured, serverless social media application. Let's recap what we've accomplished across all four parts:

1. Part 1: Architecture and setup
2. Part 2: User authentication
3. Part 3: Posts and feed system
4. Part 4: Social features and real-time updates

The possibilities for extending this application are endless. We hope this series has given you the confidence to build your own serverless applications on AWS.

Happy coding!
