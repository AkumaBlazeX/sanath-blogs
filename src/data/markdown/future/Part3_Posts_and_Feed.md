# Part 3: Building the Social Feed with DynamoDB and Lambda

Welcome to Part 3 of our series! With authentication in place, let's build the core feature of our social media application: the post creation and feed system. We'll use DynamoDB for data storage, Lambda for processing, and S3 for image handling.

## Designing the Data Model

First, let's design our DynamoDB table structure:

```typescript
// Example Post Item Structure
{
  postId: string;
  userId: string;
  content: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

### Setting Up DynamoDB

Let's create our table with the right indexes:

## Creating Lambda Functions

We'll need several Lambda functions to handle different operations:

### Create Post Function

[SCREENSHOT 4: Show Lambda function code in AWS Console]
Caption: "Implementation of create-post Lambda function"

```typescript
// functions/create-post.ts
import { DynamoDB } from 'aws-sdk';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

// ... [Create post Lambda code will be shown here]
```

### Get Feed Function

```typescript
// functions/get-feed.ts
import { DynamoDB } from 'aws-sdk';

// ... [Get feed Lambda code will be shown here]
```

## Setting Up API Gateway

Now let's create our API endpoints:

## Image Upload to S3

Let's implement secure image uploads:

```typescript
// src/utils/imageUpload.ts
import { S3 } from 'aws-sdk';

// ... [Image upload utility code will be shown here]
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Post Creation Component

[SCREENSHOT 8: Show post creation UI]
Caption: "Post creation form with image upload"

```typescript
// src/components/CreatePost.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

// ... [Create post component code will be shown here]
```

### Feed Component

[SCREENSHOT 9: Show feed implementation]
Caption: "Social feed with infinite scroll"

```typescript
// src/components/Feed.tsx
import { useInfiniteQuery } from 'react-query';
import { Post } from '../types';

// ... [Feed component code will be shown here]
```

## Implementing Infinite Scroll

Let's add smooth infinite scrolling:

[SCREENSHOT 10: Show infinite scroll in action]
Caption: "Infinite scroll implementation in the feed"

```typescript
// src/hooks/useInfiniteScroll.ts
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer';

// ... [Infinite scroll hook code will be shown here]
```

## Performance Optimization

### Image Compression

[SCREENSHOT 11: Show image compression implementation]
Caption: "Client-side image compression before upload"

```typescript
// src/utils/imageCompression.ts
import imageCompression from 'browser-image-compression';

// ... [Image compression utility code will be shown here]
```

### Query Optimization

## Testing the Feed System

Let's verify our implementation:

## What's Next?

In Part 4, we'll add social features to our application - likes and comments. We'll extend our DynamoDB schema, create new Lambda functions for these interactions, and implement real-time updates using WebSocket connections.

Stay tuned for the final part of our series!
