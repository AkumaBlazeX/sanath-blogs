## **Step-by-Step Process** 

### **1. Start with Google Sheets**  
**What it does**: Triggers the workflow when you add a new blog idea to your Google Sheets.  
**How does it work:**

Here I have given the input as this:

| Id | Title        | Subtitle        | Subject | Keywords       | Tags       | Tone        | Image      | Target\_Audience |
| -- | ------------ | --------------- | ------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 1  | Sample Title | Sample Subtitle | Tech    | AI, Automation | Tech, Blog | Informative | Image1.jpg | Gen-Z Creators   |

Taking this as input, our custom AI agent can trigger with the message we write in the next section. To connect Google Sheets, follow the [n8n Google Sheets setup guide](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/#use-secrets-in-n8n-credentials).

### **2. Generate Content with OpenAI**

**What it does**: Uses AI to write a full blog post from your topic and keywords.  
**How does this work:**

In this step, we must follow OpenAI's guidelines to create API keys for connecting our n8n workflow with ChatGPT.

Refer to these resources for guidance:

- [OpenAI API setup](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
- [n8n OpenAI integration](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/)

In order to get the best output, refer to this sample image that illustrates how the content is structured:

### **3. Edit Your Content** 
**What it does**: Lets you tweak the AI's draft to match your voice.  
**Example**: Change formal phrases like *"One may consider"* to *"You should totally try..."*  
**Why are we using this**: Because ChatGPT may hallucinate or provide inaccurate information, so this editing step ensures high-quality content.

### **4. Split Content for Sharing**  
**What it does**: Breaks your blog into bite-sized pieces for social media, emails, etc.  
**How and Why are we doing this:** Content is divided for both **Slack** and **Notion** to streamline distribution.

### **5. Notify Your Team on Slack** 
**What it does**: Sends a Slack message when the blog is ready.  
**How can we achieve this:** Follow the [Slack setup guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/) for steps to create a channel, app, OAuth ID, and scopes to connect Slack with n8n.

### **6. Organize in Notion** 
**What it does**: Saves your blog details (title, tags, publish date) in a Notion database.  
**How does this work:** Follow this [Notion setup guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/notion/) to connect your Notion workspace with n8n.

### **7. Add Custom Magic with Code** 
**What it does**: Runs scripts for advanced tasks.  
**How does this help:** Upon success, this step triggers a status code `200` to confirm completion and sends an email to subscribers. It also uses an OpenAI agent to notify that new content is available with a link for readers. Follow Steps 1 and 2 to set this up.

### **8. Email Your Subscribers** 
**What it does**: Sends personalized emails to your audience.  
**How does this work:** Like Google Sheets integration, add a Gmail node in n8n and configure your account for email automation.

Now our workflow is ready to send content models.

## **Full Workflow in Action** ðŸŽ®

1. Add a blog idea to **Google Sheets** â†’ triggers the workflow.
2. **OpenAI** writes the draft â†’ you edit it.
